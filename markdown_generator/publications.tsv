Because of their simplified design, they are unable to reproduce the dexterity of human hands when manipulating a wide range of objects. While the control of humanoid hands evolved greatly, hardware platforms still lack capabilities, particularly in tactile sensing and providing soft contact surfaces. In this work, we present a method that equips the skeleton of a tendon-driven humanoid hand with a soft and sensorized tactile skin. Multi-material 3D printing allows us to iteratively approach a cast skin design which preserves the robot's dexterity in terms of range of motion and speed. We demonstrate that a soft skin enables firmer grasps and piezoresistive sensor integration enhances the hand's tactile sensing capabilities.	Egli, Jana et al. (2024).
