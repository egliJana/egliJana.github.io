I am a Ph.D. candidate as part of the Center for Learning Systems (CLS). My research is done at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems (MPI) and ETH Zurich.

I am interested in human-centered robotics. Isn't it fascinating how technology can facilitate our daily life and may even become part of us? to benefit from advanced technologies, we have to understand how we interact with the robots in a safe manner. Therefore, I am curious to investigate what we can do in soft robotics to improve safety and efficiency. How we can establish reliable and powerful systems regarding material selection, power supply and overall system integration.
